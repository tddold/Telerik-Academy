/*Problem 2. Students and workers
 * Define abstract class Human with a first name and a last name. Define a new class Student which is 
 * derived from Human and has a new field – grade. Define class Worker derived from Human with a new 
 * property WeekSalary and WorkHoursPerDay and a method MoneyPerHour() that returns money earned per 
 * hour by the worker. Define the proper constructors and properties for this hierarchy.
 * Initialize a list of 10 students and sort them by grade in ascending order (use LINQ or OrderBy() 
 * extension method).
 * Initialize a list of 10 workers and sort them by money per hour in descending order.
 * Merge the lists and sort them by first name and last name.*/

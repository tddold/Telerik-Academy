/*
 * 4. Implement the data structure "hash table" in a class 
 * HashTable<K,T>. Keep the data in array of lists of key-value
 * pairs (LinkedList<KeyValuePair<K,T>>[]) with initial 
 * capacity of 16. When the hash table load runs over 75%,
 * perform resizing to 2 times larger capacity. Implement
 * the following methods and properties: Add(key, value), 
 * Find(key) -> value, Remove( key), Count, Clear(), this[], 
 * Keys. Try to make the hash table to support iterating over
 * its elements with foreach.

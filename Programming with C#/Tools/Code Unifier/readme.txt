Code Unifier program unifies your c# or *.txt files to one, complete file. The default output format
is set to *.txt. The files you would like to unify should be in one directory.
While developing leave the usings at their
default place, above the namespace. Your files, should be developed in a similar way - they all should have namespace,
or all shouldn't.

1. Open "Code unifier.exe".
2. Click on the "Browse" button and choose your files. There is no maximum or minimum number of files to be chosen.
3. Press "Unify files!" button. After a second there should be a message box informing, about success or failure.
4. If successfull, you should look for "BGCoderOutputFile.txt" in the folder of your project (the folder, where you have
	chosen the files).
5. That is all.

Happy exam preparation to you! :)

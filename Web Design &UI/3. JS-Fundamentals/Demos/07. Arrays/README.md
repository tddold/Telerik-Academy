Arrays
======

### Problem 1. Increase array members
*	Write a script that allocates array of 20 integers and initializes each element by its index multiplied by `5`.
*	Print the obtained array on the console.

### Problem 2. Lexicographically comparison
*	Write a script that compares two char arrays lexicographically (letter by letter).

### Problem 3. Maximal sequence 
*	Write a script that finds the **maximal sequence** of equal elements in an array.

_Example:_

|              input               | result  |
|----------------------------------|---------|
| 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, **2, 2, 2**, 1 | 2, 2, 2 |

### Problem 4. Maximal increasing sequence
*	Write a script that finds the maximal increasing sequence in an array.

_Example:_

|          input          | result  |
|-------------------------|---------|
| 3, **2, 3, 4**, 2, 2, 4 | 2, 3, 4 |

### Problem 5. Selection sort
*	Sorting an array means to arrange its elements in increasing order.
*	Write a script to sort an array.
*	Use the [selection sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort) algorithm: Find the smallest element, move it at the first position, find the smallest from the rest, move it at the second position, etc.

_Hint: Use a second array_

### Problem 6. Most frequent number
*	Write a script that finds the most frequent number in an array. 

_Example:_

|                  input                |    result   |
|---------------------------------------|-------------|
| **4**, 1, 1, **4**, 2, 3, **4**, **4**, 1, 2, **4**, 9, 3 | 4 (5 times) |

### Problem 7. Binary search
*	Write a script that finds the index of given element in a sorted array of integers by using the [binary search](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm) algorithm.
